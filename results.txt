The sharp fall in sterling is already feeding through to corporate earnings expectations, with some companies warning of a negative drag from the exchange rate shift but others hoping to see a boost in the bottom line.
Pest control company Rentokil, which is listed on the FTSE 250, said on Thursday that the positive impact from currency moves on profits for 2016 could almost double as a result of the recent slide in the pound.
This article has been amended to clarify that the positive effect on Rentokil’s profits from currency moves could double from the fall in the pound, not the company’s total profits.

In a previously unpublished memo from July 2002, Mr Blair told Mr Bush: “I will be with you, whatever.” That commitment — given without consulting colleagues — made it “very difficult for the UK subsequently to withdraw its support” for the March 2003 invasion, the report found.
Crucially, the report rejects Mr Blair’s arguments that diplomatic options for controlling Iraq’s weapons programmes — particularly via the UN — were not worth pursuing further by March 2003.
Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats, the only major party to oppose the invasion, said Mr Blair and Mr Bush had “created a failed state which continues to be the source of extremism and instability across [the] Middle East”.

Yet to deny their sexual associations, and that of the iconic forms abstracted from nature here — deep cavities encased by purple folds in “Dark Iris”, thrusting stalks and softly opening petals in “Calla Lilies on Red”, the inward-moving eddies of “Pool in the Woods, Lake George” — is really not to see them at all.
Often they took the same subjects: his “Equivalent” cloud series and her bulbous cloud shapes in “A Celebration”, painted at their marriage in 1924; her visions of New York’s buildings against gleaming patches of sky — “New York Street with Moon”, “Ritz Tower, Night” — versus his austere geometric cityscapes such as “New York from An American Place”.
Tate is right, too, that the bleached animal skulls that O’Keeffe collected there are allegories of nationhood and identity.

The problem here, as Cole-Hamilton concedes, is that the museum decided not to include any live animals or plants in the show — and preserved specimens, whether fossils or modern, rarely keep the full colouration they had in life.

The Mirakhmedov company signed with a BSI address in Switzerland; the Marshall Islands company provided a Latvian account number at the Ukrainian-owned Privat Bank, an institution that would years later become notorious for its alleged role in one of eastern Europe’s biggest money laundering scandals.

Tony Blair committed to an invasion of Iraq almost eight months before receiving parliamentary and legal backing, and began military action before diplomatic alternatives were exhausted, a much-awaited inquiry into the conflict has concluded.
The report by Sir John Chilcot, a former civil servant, amounts to an excoriating verdict on Britain’s political, military and intelligence establishments, all of which are heavily implicated for misjudgments and occasionally ineptitude.
Future documents should have a “clear separation of responsibility” between those assessing the intelligence and those making the argument for policy.

Tony Blair committed to an invasion of Iraq almost eight months before receiving parliamentary and legal backing, and began military action before diplomatic alternatives were exhausted, a much-awaited inquiry into the conflict has concluded.
It also is likely to shape forever the legacy of a leader who was once one of Britain’s most popular postwar premiers, only to become a figure of intense divisiveness at home after committing himself as the closest wartime ally of US President George W Bush.
The findings will bring some comfort to those on both sides of the argument, writes Sebastian Payne He said the former prime minister should acknowledge “his catastrophic mistake”, and that Tory politicians, including Theresa May, the leadership frontrunner, should be held responsible for their support for the war.

The directions of their tracks suggest that they had simple photoreceptor cells containing molecules sensitive to light, which could detect the shadow of another animal passing by or guide them to brightly lit areas where their microbial food sources were more likely to be found.
The genetic change responsible for primate colour vision is believed to have evolved in ancestral monkeys about 30 million years ago, says Anya Hurlbert, professor of visual neuroscience at Newcastle University.
Her latest research at the museum shows that porphyrin pigments, similar to those implicated in the human metabolic disorder porphyria (one of the symptoms of which is that skin is very sensitive to light), play the key role in producing the red, pink and orange colours in marine snails.

Announcing BSI’s settlement, Stuart F Delery, then number three at the justice department in Washington, called the initiative to settle with Swiss banks “an innovative effort to get the financial institutions that facilitated a massive fraud on the American tax system to come forward with information about their wrongdoing — and to ensure that they are held responsible for it”.
Those deals have attracted attention — including from a panel led by former UN chief Kofi Annan — to a series of secretive offshore transactions through which ENRC bought Congolese copper rights from Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining tycoon close to the country’s president.
Defenders of offshore secrecy argue that it can have legitimate purposes, such as, say, allowing a politically active businesswoman in Belarus or Egypt or Venezuela to ensure that, even if the authorities come for her, they will not be able to track down the funds she has hidden away to provide for her family.

The assurance contributed to Lord Goldsmith’s revised conclusion, made on the invasion’s eve, that the conflict was legal — but the report finds “the precise basis on which Mr Blair made that decision was not clear”.
